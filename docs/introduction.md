# What is Sll?

Sll is a **general-purpose programing language** aimed at **all developers** looking for a **non-OOP** language with heavy compile-time optimization (and therefor **better runtime performance**).

Sll can be used for many different applications, from back-end server-side software development to complex AI-driven path-finding systems.

Key features of Sll:
- Cross-platform (Tested on Windows 10 64-bit and multiple Linux x64 distributions)
- Easy to learn (Similar to Lisp)
- Heavy compile-time optimization

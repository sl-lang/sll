# Sll [0.5.2] - 2021-07-31

## Changed

- `(@@)` (return) operator now compiles into the exit operator (`(@)`) if used outside of a function
- `ASSERT` macro now only works in debug builds
- VM now uses a call stack instead of the `LLL_ASSEMBLY_INSTRUCTION_TYPE_PUSH_II` instruction
- VM now uses a stack index instead of a moving pointer

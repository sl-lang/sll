# Sll [0.4.1] - 2021-07-29

## Added

- A level-3 optimization (`-O3`), which performs global optimization of the compiled object
- Assembly instructions for returning different types
- Errors related to invalid instructions, stack corruption and an invalid instruction index
- `LLL_ASSEMBLY_INSTRUCTION_TYPE_POP_ROT` instruction
- Two new operators: `(@)` (exit) and `(@@)` (return)

## Changed

- In a debug build, the `UNREACHABLE()` macro expands into `ASSERT(!"Unreachable")`
- Operator assembly instruction can be used directly on a variable

## Removed

- `LLL_ASSEMBLY_INSTRUCTION_TYPE_PUSH_NIL` instruction
- `lll_optimize_object` function
- `LLL_RUNTIME_OBJECT_TYPE_TRUE` and `LLL_RUNTIME_OBJECT_TYPE_FALSE` runtime object types

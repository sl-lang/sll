# Sll [0.7.24] - Ongoing

## Added

- Extended the container API to include macro-substitution-functions: `sll_container_clear` and `sll_container_filter`
- Implemented `sll_container_check_callback_t` and `sll_container_delete_callback_t`

## Changed

- Build script no longer uses nightly versions of Sll
- Conditional arguments in `SLL_CONTAINER_FILTER` and `SLL_HANDLE_CONTAINER_FILTER` have been flipped to better reflect their meaning

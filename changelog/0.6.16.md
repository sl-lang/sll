# Sll [0.6.16] - 2021-08-30

## Added

- Ability to upload the executable to the website
- Bit shifting operators ([#30]): `(<<)` and `(>>)` as well as their `SLL_OBJECT_TYPE_` and `SLL_ASSEMBLY_INSTRUCTION_TYPE_` counterparts (This also includes updates to the syntax highlight)
- Fixed macro parsing in the builder script
- Fixed memory leak in `sll_add_string` ([#32]) and memory corruption in `sll__add_debug_data` ([#33])
- Handles
- JSON module ([#34])
- New object creation macro: `SLL_FROM_HANDLE` (and `sll_handle_to_object`)
- New option for updating sll from the CLI (`-U`) ([#35])
- New static object: `handle_zero`
- `sll_current_runtime_data` holds the current runtime data of the program (Can be used to ex. create handle types or write directly to output)
- `SLL_ERROR_UNRELEASED_OBJECTS` error: Raised when not all objects (allocated during execution of the program) have been `SLL_RELEASE`d
- `sll_platform_setup_console` and `sll_platform_reset_console`: On Windows, is sets the output mode to binary
- This Change Log!

### Handles

Handles can be used to uniquely identify an object. They are a replacement for `SLL_RUNTIME_TYPE_INT`. They consists of the handle itself (`sll_handle_t`) and a type (`sll_handle_type_t`).

| Feature | SLL_RUNTIME_TYPE_INT | SLL_RUNTIME_TYPE_HANDLE |
|-|-|-|
| Range | -2\^63 to 2^63-1 | 0 to 2^64-1 |
| Type Range | N/A | 0 to 2^32-1 |
| Multiple Types | No | Yes |
| Type Name | No | Yes (up to 256 characters) |
| Automatic Cleanup | No | Yes |
| Arithmetic Operations | Yes | Yes |

Handle types can be create by calling `sll_create_handle()` and specifying the name of the new handle type and its destructor. The destructor is automatically called when the last instance of the object gets released. The destructor also gets called when the handle type is deregistered.
If a handles does not have a type (`SLL_UNKNOWN_HANDLE_TYPE`) it has a boolean value of zero. Otherwise, it has a boolean value of one.

## Changed

- Constant string objects in [`src/sll/vm.c`][0.6.16/src/sll/vm.c] now use part of the user-supplied stack instead of `malloc()`
- Renamed `SLL_MAX_ARGUMENT_COUNT` to `SLL_MAX_ARG_COUNT`
- Renamed top-of-stack variables in [`src/sll/vm.c`][0.6.16/src/sll/vm.c] to `tos`
- `sll_execute_assembly` now expects `sll_runtime_data_t` instead of multiple parameters

## Removed

- `SLL_UNIMPLEMENTED()` statements in [`src/sll/operator.c`][0.6.16/src/sll/operator.c]
- Unused constant `INVALID_FILE_HANDLE` and unused macro `SLL_API_INVALID_FILE_HANDLE`

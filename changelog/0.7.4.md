- Implemented `sll_get_call_stack` ([#173])
- Implemented `thread$lock_type`, `thread$acquire_lock`, `thread$create_lock` and `thread$release_lock` ([#173] and [#175])
- Implemented `thread$thread_type`, `thread$STATE_RUNNING`, `thread$STATE_WAITING`, `thread$STATE_TERMINATED`, `thread$current`, `thread$get`, `thread$join` and `thread$start` ([#173] and [#175])
- Implemented `thread.sll` ([#173] and [#175])
- Multithreading support ([#173] and [#177])
- Tests can be executed by running `sll tests/_runner.sll` or by passing the `--test` flag to the builder script ([#8])
- Thread waiting operator (`(!<<)`) and current thread identification getter (`(!.)`) ([#173] and [#175])
- Variable argument function call operator (`(<-*)`) ([#232])

## Changed

- Array functions now use `sll_operator_strict_equal` instead of `sll_operator_equal`
- Fixed `sll_process_join_args`
- Fixed incorrect results returned by `sll_string_compare_pointer`
- Fixed memory leaks related to unreleased objects (invalidated [#25])
- Fixed multiple inconsistencies with different operators
- Fixed reference counting and double-free in `file.sll`
- Fixed variable names related to compilation data and source files
- Function `time$time_function` now accepts arguments passed to the timed function
- Function variables are now stack based and not register-based ([#26])
- If (`(?)`), inline if (`(?:)`) and switch (`(??)`) operators now assign new scopes for every condition and code block pair
- JSON API functions now encode and decode the 4-character escape (`\u00{N}{N}`) instead of the invalid 2-character escape (`\x{N}{N}`)
- *\[Windows only\]* Separate executables for console mode (`sll.exe`) and window mode (`sllw.exe`) are now generated
- Variable arguments are now properly handled in `file$write`
- VM now stores execution data based on threads ([#173] and [#177])

## Removed

- Console creation function (`sll_platform_create_console`) and CLI option to suppress window creation
- Console initialization functions: `sll_platform_setup_console` and `sll_platform_reset_console`
- Memory fail text is no longer present in the exported header file
- Recursive calls to `sll_execute_assembly` are no longer allowed

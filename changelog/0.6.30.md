# Sll [0.6.30] - 2021-12-05

## Added

- Ability to access elements of custom types (or maps) from variables by using the `|# variable #|$|# field 1#|$|# field 2#|$|# field 3#|` syntax
- Ability to clone structures without references (by the `(: |# object #|)` syntax)
- Finished custom object type API ([#72])
- `func_type` which is an alias to `int_type`
- Implemented buffered file reading
- Implemented increment (`(++)`) and decrement (`(--)`) operators ([#96])
- Implemented `sll_api_string_split`, `sll_api_array_create`, `sll:string_split` and `sll:array_create` ([#87])
- Implemented `SLL_OBJECT_GET_TYPE_MASK` and `sll_array_zero`
- Memory structures can have constant fields (denoted by inverting (`(~)`) the type) ([#99])
- More examples ([#77])

## Changed

- Fixed storage type handling in structure objects
- Function calls now properly manage the stack ([#27])
- Internal Functions are now named according to [#73]
- Renamed the import operator from `(--)` to `(---)` ([#96])
- Structure fields are now declared as identifiers and are marked by an internal type (`SLL_NODE_TYPE_FIELD`)
- Syntax highlight now correctly marks type declarations

## Removed

- URL & socket APIs (Therefore invalidated [#66])
